`omnipkg` obliterates Python dependency hell, making tools like pipx, uv, conda, and Docker obsolete for managing conflicting packages. Born from a real-world nightmare‚Äîa forced downgrade that wrecked a conda-forge environment on a Friday night‚Äî`omnipkg` was built in a weekend (yes) to solve what others couldn‚Äôt: running multiple versions of the same package in one environment without conflicts. And it‚Äôs battle-tested to prove it.

## üöÄ Why omnipkg Changes Everything

Dependency conflicts have cost Python developers billions in lost productivity. Legacy projects needing `tensorflow==1.15` and modern ones requiring `tensorflow==2.13.0` couldn‚Äôt coexist‚Äîuntil now. `omnipkg` lets you run infinite package versions in a single environment, with zero waste and mathematically impossible conflicts.

How? Through Surgical Version Bubbles, `omnipkg` isolates only conflicting packages and their dependencies, sharing compatible ones to save up to 60% disk space. Switch versions mid-script with `omnipkgLoader`, revert damage instantly with `omnipkg revert`, and manage it all with a sleek CLI.

Don't believe me? Our CI pipelines validate every claim with live, real-world tests. See for yourself.

## üî• The ‚ÄúImpossible‚Äù Made Simple

Want to install conflicting package versions in one command? `omnipkg` makes it effortless.

```bash
omnipkg install torch==2.0.0 torch==2.7.1
```

What happens? `omnipkg` reorders installs to trigger the bubble creation, installs `torch==2.7.1` in the main environment, and isolates `torch==2.0.0` in a "bubble." No more containers or multiple environments.

```
üîÑ Reordered: torch==2.7.1, torch==2.0.0
üì¶ Installing torch==2.7.1... ‚úÖ Done
üõ°Ô∏è Downgrade detected for torch==2.0.0
ü´ß Creating bubble for torch==2.0.0... ‚úÖ Done
üîÑ Restoring torch==2.7.1... ‚úÖ Environment secure
```

## üß† Revolutionary Features

### 1. Dynamic Version Switching
Switch package versions mid-script without restarting or changing environments, using `omnipkgLoader`. Run `numpy==1.24.3` and `numpy==1.26.4` in the same Python process.

```python
from omnipkg.loader import omnipkgLoader
from omnipkg.core import ConfigManager # Recommended for robust path discovery

config = ConfigManager().config # Load your omnipkg config once

with omnipkgLoader("numpy==1.24.3", config=config):
    import numpy
    print(numpy.__version__)  # Outputs: 1.24.3
import numpy # Re-import/reload might be needed if numpy was imported before the 'with' block
print(numpy.__version__)  # Outputs: Original main env version (e.g., 1.26.4)
```

### 2. Surgical Version Bubbles
Conflicting versions live in lightweight, isolated bubbles with only necessary files. Compatible dependencies are shared, slashing storage by up to 60%.

### 3. Guardian Protocol
Prevents environment-breaking downgrades by auto-reordering installs and isolating conflicts. Try breaking it‚Äîyou can't!

### 4. Binary and C-Extension Mastery
Seamlessly switch binary tools (e.g., `uv`) and C-extension version combos (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`) during runtime which were previously thought impossible.

### 5. Instant Recovery
`omnipkg revert` restores your environment to a ‚Äúlast known good‚Äù state in seconds, undoing damage from `pip`, `uv`, or any other tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Get Started in 60 Seconds

Install `omnipkg` (requires Redis server to be running):

```bash
pip install omnipkg
```

**Install Redis:**

*   **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**: `sudo apt-get install redis-server`
*   **macOS (Homebrew)**: `brew install redis`
*   **Windows**: Use WSL2 or Docker (e.g., `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis`)

**Run the Demo:**
```bash
omnipkg demo
```
Choose from Python module, binary, C-extension, or TensorFlow tests to see `omnipkg` in action.

**Try the Stress Test:**
```bash
omnipkg stress-test
```
Watch `omnipkg` juggle complex `numpy` and `scipy` versions flawlessly.

## üî¨ How It Works

1.  **Install Normally**: Use standard `pip install` or `omnipkg install <package>`.
2.  **Auto-Detect Conflicts**: `omnipkg` spots version clashes and isolates them in bubbles.
3.  **Dynamic Switching**: Use `omnipkgLoader` to switch versions mid-script.
4.  **Redis-Powered Speed**: A high-performance knowledge base ensures metadata lookups at **9 packages/second**.
5.  **Atomic Snapshots**: Instant rollback with `omnipkg revert`.

**Example: Safe Flask-Login Downgrade:**
```bash
omnipkg install flask-login==0.4.1
```

```
üì∏ Taking LIVE pre-installation snapshot...
    - Found 545 packages

üõ°Ô∏è DOWNGRADE PROTECTION ACTIVATED!
-> Detected conflict: flask-login v0.6.3 ‚Üí v0.4.1
ü´ß Creating bubble for flask-login v0.4.1
    ...
    ‚úÖ Dependencies resolved via PyPI API
    ...
    ‚úÖ Bubble created: 151 files copied, 188 deduplicated
    üìä Space saved: 55.5%
    üîÑ Restoring flask-login v0.6.3...

‚úÖ Environment secured!

# Verify final state
$ omnipkg info flask-login

üìã flask-login STATUS:
----------------------------------------
üéØ Active: 0.6.3 (protected)
ü´ß Available: 0.4.1 (in bubble)
üìä Space Saved: 55.5%
```
You now have both versions available in one environment, ready for use anytime!
